### Results Excerpt

* WRKY2 Directly Activates Transcription of WOX8 via Its W-box Promoter Motif
* WRKY2 Regulates WOX8 and WOX9 Expression and Basal Cell Division Patterns during Early Embryogenesis
* WRKY2 Is Required to Repolarize the Zygote from a Transient Symmetric State
* WRKY2-Dependent Repolarization Is Mediated via WOX8 Transcription in the Zygote Itself

### Discussion

WOX8/9 genes are axis patterning genes, which WRKY2 is a direct transcriptional regulator. This regulation pathway was known for the regulation of asymmetric embryo lineage development which occurs after the division of the zygote. This paper states that it also regulates the polarity of the zygote itself.

The expression "transient symmetric state" is used in this paper to note the finding that the polarized state of the egg cell is not contiguous in the developmental stage, and re-polarization of the zygote requires WRKY2. 

WOX8 and WOX9 genes are functional homologues. It is not shown in the paper how WOX8 expression is confined to the basal daughter.
