> [Cadet](https://github.com/limeburst/cadet) is a keyboard controller for the ATmega32u4 written in [Ivory](https://ivorylang.org/), a Haskell EDSL for safe systems programming. Ivory was designed for implementing high-assurance software for UAVs, but why not put it in a keyboard? [Space Cadet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard) was a keyboard used on LISP machine, and in this incarnation, its keycaps go on a board with the controller written in Ivory. Hence my keyboard's name: Ivory Cadet. My academic interest is in software verification and provable correctness, so the logic symbols of the Space Cadet keycaps and the controller implementation language turned out to be a perfect match for me! :D

> The switches were actually a gift from cookie, from when I was translating between Happy for running the HHKB metal sticker GB. Thanks cookie! The keycaps are unmistakably the Space Cadet set from 7bit's [Round 6](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Round_6), with small cadet legends. Thanks to 7bit for accommodating my last minute order changes, and of course running the group buy! I couldn't have finished this board without Deskthority, so thank you all. ;)

> What next? Cadet still contains some C code, mostly from the Teensy USB stack. I plan to rewrite these into Ivory. [Unicode input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_input) support for the logic symbols is a priority too. I'll make sure to update progress on this thread. I'd also like to see some more ducks on the board and maybe a hashbang, so I've put in orders for facetsesame's Honey Spherical Extras. Lastly, how do I go about bribing 7bit into running the Space Cadet set with front printed legends for Round 8? :evilgeek:
