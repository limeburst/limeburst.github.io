* Protein N-glycosylation are support of correct folding and protection from degradation.
* Underglycosylation leads to protein being found in ER.
* N-glycan modifications occurring during passage through the Golgi apparatus are not essential for function of EFR and FLS2 PRR proteins.
* Tunicamycin causes severe underglycosylation, crippling ligand recognition.
* Even in the case of underglycosylation, protein folding is uninterrupted. However, ligand recognition is degraded.
